After the successful registration or login, customers can explore the different foods that the shop is offering. By default, users will be redirected to the list of the food categories. The categories on this project are Pizza, Subway Dishes, Salad, Pasta, and Diner Platter food. Customers or Users can select up to 3 different toppings for each ordered pizza. The Admin Users must log in to the Customer Site to mark the pending orders to deliver.
